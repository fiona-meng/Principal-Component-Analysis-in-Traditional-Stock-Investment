# Principal Component Analysis in Traditional Stock Investment

Supposing the market now is already efficient and all the stocks are priced fairly. 
But in the relatively short time period, the price maybe wrong because investor are 
not rational and over-reacting to some unex- pected news. Then arbitrage will appear.
We are able to filter the stocks which are relatively undervalued or relatively 
overvalued by using PCA. Then we can long undervalued ones and short the overvalued 
ones. We authenticate our method by our pitching stocks and it works well. High return beat the market.
